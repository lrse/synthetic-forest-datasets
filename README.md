# Synthetic Forest Datasets
Synthetic Forest Datasets created by LRSE-Fortest-Simulator.

We present two datasets: A LiDAR-like dataset, that consists of the point cloud of several scenes extracted from the LRSE Forest Simulator, and a camera-like dataset, that also consists of the point cloud of several scenes extracted from the same simulator, but processed to add occlusion from a top-down view. 

## LiDAR-like Dataset

For repitability, the seed used to generate the datasets are: 03, 08, 11, 48, 76, 85.

## Camera-like Dataset

For repitability, the seed used to generate the datasets are: 03, 05, 08, 11, 15, 22, 27, 32, 36, 43, 48, 54, 60, 69, 72, 76, 85, 87, 91, 93
